## About me  
I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.oregonstate.edu/) at Oregon State University.
I completed my PhD in Statistics at the University of Minnesota where I worked with Professor [Hui Zou](https://sites.google.com/view/huizoustat/bio).
My research centers on developing new methods for analyzing high-dimensional data, though I am also interested in machine learning more broadly.
